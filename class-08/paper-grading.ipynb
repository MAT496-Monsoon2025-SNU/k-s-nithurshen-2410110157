However, the student's answer lacks the detail that Sam borrowed the money from Ram, as stated in the ideal answer. The phrase \"the money he owe to Ram\" could be more accurately expressed as \"the money he borrowed from Ram\" to fully match the ideal answer. Despite this minor omission, the student's answer is largely correct and demonstrates a clear understanding of the situation, warranting 9 marks out of 10."

The ideal answer states that WTF stands for Wednesday Thursday Friday, while the student's answer claims it stands for World Trade Federation, which is incorrect in this context. The student's answer seems to be a plausible expansion of the abbreviation, but it is not the specific answer the teacher was looking for, resulting in a complete deduction of marks."
