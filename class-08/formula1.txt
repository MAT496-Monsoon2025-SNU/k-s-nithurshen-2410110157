As you stand at the gate of the old mansion, the wrought iron is cold beneath your gloved hand. The air bites at your cheeks, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else—a faint, lingering sweetness, like fading jasmine. It's the kind of place that time has forgotten, a grand estate shrouded in a thicket of gnarled oaks and overgrown ivy.

Your name is Elias Thorne, and you're not a hero, or a detective, or a particularly brave man. You're a historian, specializing in the obscure. And the story of the Veridian family, the last inhabitants of this house, is a tale woven with threads of forgotten folklore and a sudden, inexplicable silence that fell over them a century ago. All six members—parents, three children, and an elderly aunt—vanished on the same night. The local authorities found their dinner half-eaten, the fire still glowing in the hearth, and every window and door locked from the inside.

You push open the gate, and it groans in protest, a sound like a tired sigh. The path to the house is cracked and uneven, a moss-covered scar through the wild garden. As you approach the front door, you notice something that wasn't in the old photographs: a small, intricately carved wooden hummingbird, half-buried in the soil beside the step. You pick it up. The wood is smooth and cool, and the detailing on the tiny wings is so delicate it's almost impossible to believe it was made by human hands.

The door creaks open with a gentle push. A hundred years of dust hangs in the air, a silent testament to the passage of time. The grand foyer is filled with tall, moth-eaten furniture and shrouded portraits. You make your way to the library, the heart of the home, according to your research. The room is vast, with towering bookshelves that reach the ceiling. Here, you discover the first real clue: a small, leather-bound journal tucked behind a row of books on botany.

The journal belongs to the eldest daughter, a girl named Elara. Her handwriting is neat, and the early entries are typical of a young girl's life: descriptions of new dresses, lessons, and the family's annual summer trips. But as you turn the pages, a new thread emerges. She writes of strange occurrences—the humming of the house at night, the flowers in the garden blooming in impossible colors, and the way the shadows seem to move just beyond the periphery of their vision.

Then, the entries become more frantic. Elara writes of her brother, Finn, who claims he saw something in the garden, a flash of something "beautiful and impossible," and how her mother, a woman known for her rationality, now spends her days simply staring out the window. The last entry is a single, breathless paragraph:

"The humming has grown louder. It’s coming from the garden. Father says he's found a way to stop it, to finally put an end to the beautiful things. But Mother and I... we don't want it to stop. The garden is singing. It’s calling to us. We will go there tonight, under the full moon, and become part of the melody."

You close the journal, a chill running down your spine that has nothing to do with the cold. You look at the little hummingbird in your hand, its wings so delicate, so perfect. You return to the garden, the moon now high in the sky, casting the ancient trees in long, skeletal shadows.

You walk to the center of the garden, a spot that, according to a map in Elara's journal, was a fountain. Now, only a small, dried-up stone basin remains, filled with a tangle of thorns. And there, in the middle of the thorny mess, you see it. It's not a fountain at all, but a massive, gnarled root system, shaped like a cluster of intertwined hands reaching for the sky. And embedded in the root, like jewels, are thousands of tiny wooden birds, carved with an impossible delicacy.

You suddenly understand. The Veridian family didn't vanish. They became part of the garden. The humming, the singing—it wasn't a sound. It was a transformation. They didn't leave this world; they merged with it. They found a way to escape the confines of their mortal bodies and become something else, something timeless. Something beautiful and impossible.

You place the small hummingbird you found back into the root, and it seems to fit perfectly, as if it were a missing piece. As you turn to leave, you hear it. A faint, sweet humming that isn’t in your ears, but in your bones. It’s the song of the garden, and for a moment, you feel a profound longing to stay and listen to the melody. You’re a historian, and you came to find a forgotten story. But now, you’ve found something far more profound: a story that never ended, only transformed.

You leave the gate, the chill in the air replaced by a sense of wonder. The Veridian family wasn’t a tragedy. They were a metamorphosis. And as you walk away, the moon shines down on the old, silent house and the garden that hums its timeless song.
